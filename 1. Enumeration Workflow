--- Information Gathering ---
1. Banner grab with curl
	1.1 Any language versions?
	1.2 Server versions?

--- Enumeration ---

1. Nmap quick SYN scan with -sV and top 1000
	1.1 Scan all ports with -sV
	1.2 - Scan all results with aggressive scan
	
2. Nmap UDP scan, no flags
	2.1 - Deep scan on resulting ports
	
3. Scan each port with relevant nmap scripts
	3.1 It's ok to be tedious.
	3.2 Test ports by connecting with Netcat? Are banners different from nmap results?

4. If there are web servers:
	4.1 Check them out in the browser
		4.1.1 - Burp running and clean browser
	4.2 SSL Certificate
		4.2.1 Any subdomains? Where else is this certificate valid?
			4.2.1.1 - Add to hosts file
		4.2.2 Any email addresses
	4.3 Start Gobuster
		4.3.1 - Is it Apache? CGI discovery from Seclists
		4.3.2 - Dirbuster directory checks
		4.3.3 - Are any results access denied for folder? gobust contents of these.
	4.4 Gather information:
		4.4.1 - cewl $url -m 6 $outfile 2> /dev/null
			4.4.1.1 - john --wordlist $outfile --rules --stdout > mutated.txt
		4.4.2 - gather usernames ???????
	4.5 Any versions available? What is the site running?
		4.5.1 - Fire specific vulnerability scanner, eg, wpscan
	4.6 Start vuln scanner
	4.7 Enumerate sub-domains
